My research interest lies in the intersection of industrial data science and optimization, aiming to tackle a wide range of challenges especially within energy, manufacturing, and healthcare sectors. Specifically, I focus on developing an efficient and robust statistical framework and its methodologies to 
analyze massive amounts of complex data obtained from engineering systems, in order to understand the real world.

<b>Methodologies:</b> design and analysis of computer experiments, statistical machine learning, qualitiy and reliability engineering, nonlinear opimization, artificial intelligence.

<b>Applications:</b> digital twin/model calibration, condition monitoring, root-cause diagnostics, failure time prognostics, anomaly detection, system optimization and control.
