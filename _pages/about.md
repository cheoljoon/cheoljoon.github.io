Hello! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [Industrial and Operations Engineering](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/) with a dual degree in [Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) at the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/). 

My research interest lies in the intersection of industrial data science and optimization, aiming to  tackle a wide range of challenges within energy, manufacturing, and healthcare sectors. I currently focus on developing novel model calibration (aka. digital twin calibration) methodologies in wind power and building energy systems. 

Previously, I worked as a data scientist at [NICE Credit Bureau](https://www.niceinfo.co.kr/main.nice), where I experienced lauching a new business that leverages large-scale real estate data in South Korea. Then I joined academia through a masterâ€™s program in [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/) at [North Carolina State University, Raleigh](https://www.ncsu.edu/), where I was involved in data analytics projects to create innovative quality fault diagnostic methods for multi-stage manufacturing systems. 

Throughout my academic journey, I have had the privilege of being selected as the [Edward P. Fitts](https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/alumni/fitts-scholars-and-fellows/), [Seth Bonder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Bonder), and [IES Graduate](https://ies.engin.umich.edu/for-students/ies-graduate-student-fellowship-program/) Fellow.

<b>I will be on the job market in Fall 2024.</b>
